---Coffee example---
We are given Coffee interface with some implementations. Also we are given a static method printCoffee(Coffee),
which prints the name of the coffee with its cost.
Assume we want to sell coffee with some condiments. As we can't change printCoffee method, we will introduce
CoffeeDecorator abstract class. It can be recognized by that it implements Coffee interface and also have a constructor
with a parameter of Coffee type.

---Lowercase reader example---
We define a new LowerCaseReader class which reads a data in a lower case.
Again, LowerCaseReader has a constructor with a parameter of Reader type.
