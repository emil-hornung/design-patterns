We are given 2 different drawing programs: DrawingProgram1 and DrawingProgram2.
Both has similar functionality - they can draw a line or a circle. But their interfaces are different.
On the other hand, we would like to draw 2 shapes: a rectangle and a circle.
We would like to be able to draw those shapes using either DrawingProgram1 or DrawingProgram2.
We also would like to introduce more shapes in the future and we should
be ready to extend functionality when new DrawingProgram comes into play.
